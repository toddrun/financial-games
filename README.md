===============

I love learning new things. And I like giving back. 
So I'm going to learn a whole bunch of new stuff, 
while writing a few games centered around teaching
the basics of savings and investing. 

If you're interested in writing your own game for the
collection, send me a message. Or fork this and do what
you will with the code.

Things I want to learn or explore include:
Javascript AMD and Node
TDD unit testing modules
BDD integration testing 
Git
HTML5 Canvas and Storage

In the end, I'm hoping to have a "game master" that
can serve up any number of "participating games".
It should be possible to host a participating game as
a stand alone application (though that's not required). 
As long as the participating game exposes the correct 
interface to the master (wow, that sounds dirty), the 
game master can interact with the participant. I'm not 
100% certain how this will work, or even if the game 
master can provide any benefit to a participating
game, but it should be an interesting challenge.
