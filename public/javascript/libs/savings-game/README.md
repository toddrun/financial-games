savings-game
============

This is a simple (mostly) guessing game. 
It will present a question about an investment
of varying term and rate, asking you to determine
a value at a future date. Points, or fractions
thereof, are awarded based on elapsed time, 
accuracy and difficulty. 

This will be primarily a front-end application that
includes some interactive graphics. I hope to learn
AMD and HTML5 canvas with this project.
